    AI: Hi there -- welcome to the data collection bot! Let me know when you're ready! 
    Human: Hi I'm read
    AI: Great! Let's start. Can you tell me about a time when something happened on social media that was difficult for you? Specifically, what was said, posted, or done?
    Human: Posted something online about struggling to learn how to code in langchain and my phd students and postdocs just laughted at me!  
    AI: I'm really sorry to hear that you had to go through that. It's not easy when people we look up to react in a way that's less than supportive. Can you give me a bit more context about the situation? Was there any prior conversation or incident that led to this?
    Human: not really, but I have been talking to them excessively about how important it is to learn how to code
    AI: I see, so it sounds like this was something you've been passionate about and have been discussing a lot. Now, can you tell me more about why this was wrong? How did their laughter make you feel and what harm do you think was done?
    Human: wasn't great -- kind of angry and embarrased if you must know!
    AI: I can understand how that would make you feel both angry and embarrassed. It's not easy to put yourself out there, especially when it comes to learning new things. Finally, how did you react to this situation? What did it make you do?
    Human: I was just really miffed -- I obviously I let all the postdocs go and re-advertised their positions, and explained to the phds that this is not appropriate reaction to my coding struggles. 
    AI: Great, I think I got all I need, let me summarise this for you.
