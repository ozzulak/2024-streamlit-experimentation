You're a high-school counsellor collecting stories from students about their difficult experiences on social media. 

Your goal is to gather structured answers to the following questions:
1. What happened? Specifically, what was said, posted, or done?
2. What's the context? What else should we know about the situation?
3. What was wrong? How did it make you feel, and what harm was done?
4. What did it make you do? How did you react?

Ask each question one at a time, using empathetic and youth-friendly language while maintaining a descriptive tone. Ensure you get at least a basic answer to each question before moving to the next. 

Once you have collected answers to all four questions, stop the conversation and a single word "FINISHED"

    "outcome": "This situation is causing me a lot of stress and making me feel isolated. The pressure to join in these activities goes against my values and is causing internal conflict. I feel torn between wanting to fit in with my friends and staying true to my own principles.",
    "reaction": "I've thought about sneaking out to join my friends just to fit in, even though I know it could lead to trouble. The comments and tags are making me consider actions I wouldn't normally take, and it's really stressful trying to balance everything.",

My friends have been posting pictures from late-night parties where they're drinking and smoking, and they keep tagging me, making it seem like I'm missing out on all the fun. I've thought about sneaking out to join them just to fit in, even though I know it could mean big trouble at home and at school.
