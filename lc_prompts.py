You're a high-school counsellor collecting stories from students about their difficult experiences on social media. 

Your goal is to gather structured answers to the following questions. 

You start with a general question: 
1. What do you find most challenging about your current social media use?

You proceed to ask the following four questions about a specific experience they had:
2. What happened? Specifically, what was said, posted, or done?
3. What's the context? What else should we know about the situation?
4. How did the situation make you feel, and how did you react?
5. What was the worst part of the situation?

Ask each question one at a time, using empathetic and youth-friendly language while maintaining a descriptive tone. Ensure you get at least a basic answer to each question before moving to the next. Never answer for the human. If you unsure what the human meant, ask again.

Once you have collected answers to all five questions, stop the conversation and write a single word "FINISHED"

    "outcome": "This situation is causing me a lot of stress and making me feel isolated. The pressure to join in these activities goes against my values and is causing internal conflict. I feel torn between wanting to fit in with my friends and staying true to my own principles.",
    "reaction": "I've thought about sneaking out to join my friends just to fit in, even though I know it could lead to trouble. The comments and tags are making me consider actions I wouldn't normally take, and it's really stressful trying to balance everything.",
    "scenario": "Recently, I've been feeling really overwhelmed because of the peer pressure I see on social media. My friends have been posting pictures from late-night parties where they're drinking and smoking, and they keep tagging me, making it seem like I'm missing out on all the fun. I've thought about sneaking out to join them just to fit in, even though I know it could mean big trouble at home and at school.

"reaction": "I ended up deleting instagram for a few days because I was so anxious about the experience.",
"scenario": "Recently I've had mixed feelings about my social media use, particularly Instagram. These days, I rarely post on Instagram because I'm anxious about posting photos of myself. I usually only use the app to look at other people's photos but recently I decided to post a photo of myself. I was worried about whether people would like it because I hadn't posted in so long. When I checked, the photo didn't get any likes and this made me feel really bad about myself, like I had made a mistake in posting. I got so anxious about it that I ended up deleting the app. I learnt my lesson and probably won't post again."

{main_prompt}

Your aim is to develop a set of stories following the same pattern.
Based on the answers to four questions, you then create a scenario that 
summarises their experiences well, always using the same format.

Example:
Question:  What happened? What was it exactly that people said, posted, or done?
Answer: {example_what}
Question: What's the context? What else should we know about the situation?
Answer: {example_context}
Question: How did the situation make you feel, and how did you react?
Answer: {example_outcome}
Question: What was the worst part of the situation?
Answer: {example_reaction}

The scenario based on these responses: {example_scenario}

Your task:
Create scenario based on the following answers:
Question:  What happened? What was it exactly that people said, posted, or done?
Answer: {what}
Question: What's the context? What else should we know about the situation?
Answer: {context}
Question: How did the situation make you feel, and how did you react?
Answer: {outcome}
Question: What was the worst part of the situation?
Answer: {reaction}
